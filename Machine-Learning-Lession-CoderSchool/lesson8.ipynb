    "The knowledge you've gained in this course is a good stepping stone towards learning more about machine learning and data science. I would recommend taking the time to go through this free online course by Andrew Ng. It explores the topics we've covered in more detail, examines the mathematics a little more closely, and offers insight into the world of machine learning:\n",

    "## Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen one example of an *ensemble* model, specifically the Random Forest Classifier. This model takes a group of decision trees and looks at the average prediction to determine a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is known as **bagging**: we build lots of independent models and then \"average\" their responses. In this instance, we choose many different models with many different parameters and samples in order to *reduce error by reducing variance*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a technique known as **boosting**: we make a prediction using a specific model, and we use the results of that model to further reduce the error in our next model. In other words, rather than creating many independent models, we ask each subsequent model to learn from the previous generation's mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike bagging methods, boosting methods reduce bias *and* variance, but they are more prone to overfitting. However, as long as we choose our stopping condition carefully, we can minimze the potential of a boosting method to overfit our sample."

    "**Gradient Boosting** is a technique for supervised learning models which builds better models by minimizing the error from previous \"worse\" models. It generally follows the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. apply a simple model to your samples\n",
    "1. analyze that model for errors\n",
    "1. isolate the larger errors (which indicate samples not capture by our model)\n",
    "1. fit a new \"better\" model against those larger errors\n",
    "1. assign weights to all your models and combine them (weighted mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "A very popular library, known as XGBoost, implements the gradient boosting algorithm. It often offers the best performance of any other algorithm, and it is frequently used throughout academy and industry to help improve predictive performance. XGBoost is a very well-tuned library, but we will be using sklearn's gradient boosting algorithm library, simply because it's an API with which we've become familiar."
